# json-to-db
This is an ETL project intended to load a json file to an object then save to a DB

At this time, it saves a particular data object type to a mongoDB instance

## Todo-Maybe `:grimacing:`

- data definition and validation
- support for other DB providers - MSSQL, Postgres, etc
- Generate scripts
- Probably create a UI or an API so others can use as a DB migration tool
